# Installing Kali Linux Tools on LMDE6

Do you really need Kali Linux to use your favourite tools that come pre-compiled as part of the distribution?

What if you have another Linux distribution as your daily driver and wanted to use your tools without having to install a VM with Kali Linux?

I'm using Linux Mint Debian Edition as my daily driver and I am going to attempt to install my most favourite tools so I can use them without installing Kali.

In the next couple of posts, I will be installing (not limited to) the following tools I use on a regular basis :-

* Wireshark
* hPing
* nmap
* Burp Suite
* Nuclei
* Metasploit
* Hashcat
* John the Ripper
* aircrack-ng

The idea is to finally write a script that would ask and install all of the tools from a single script and take care of all dependencies.
